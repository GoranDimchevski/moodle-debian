moodle (1.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Since the upgrade from Moodle 1.5.x to Moodle 1.6 is a bit more complicated
    than usual, you should definitely read the following page before doing the
    real upgrade: http://docs.moodle.org/en/Upgrading_to_Moodle_1.6

  * Note that this package can be installed safely and will not mess with your
    database by itself. The process to update the database must be manually
    started.
