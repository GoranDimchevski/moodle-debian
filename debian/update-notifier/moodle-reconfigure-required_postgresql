Name: Moodle reconfigure required (postgresql)
Priority: High
Terminal: False
DontShowAfterReboot: True
Description: The moodle package was upgraded or installed, but was unable
 to contact a postgresql server.
 .
 If you were in the process of dist-upgrading, this is normal as postgresql
 is stopped for a portion of the upgrade.
 .
 If this is a fresh package installation, verify that postgresql is installed
 and running.  Once you have verified the server is running, you can reconfigure 
 the package by running 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure moodle'.
